Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

If the user passes a ticket reference, fetch it from the issue tracker and state its title before starting. If the reference is ambiguous, ask.

Call the Skill tool with "tdd" where possible, at pre-agreed seams.

Run typechecking regularly, single test files regularly, and the full test suite once at the end.

Once done, call the Skill tool with "code-review" to review the work.

Commit your work to the current branch.

## On Claude Code

If the Agent tool is available and the `ponytail` and `ponytail-review` skills are installed, split the work across two subagents instead of building and reviewing in this context. Otherwise follow the steps above.

1. Spawn an **implementer subagent** and tell it to call the Skill tool with "ponytail" to build the work, then commit to the current branch. Give it context pointers (the ticket, spec, or agreed plan), not copies. Skip the `tdd` and `code-review` steps above: the implementer owns the build, and the reviewer owns the review.
2. The subagent reports back the context you need and its implementation result: what it built, the commits, and anything it skipped or is unsure about. Keep that report in this context.
3. Once it reports done, spawn a **reviewer subagent** and tell it to call the Skill tool with "ponytail-review" on the commits the implementer made, pointing it at the same ticket or spec.
4. Relay the reviewer's findings to the user. Don't fix them unprompted.
